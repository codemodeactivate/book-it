## Description
This is our first bootcamp project in which we're required to use at least two APIs to make an interactive website that makes use of the user's local storage. We're also to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. We decided on Bulma because it had good documentation and positive reviews.

## Known Issues
Sometimes books are displayed, especially on the Have Read shelf, are cut off and shown floating through the top of the shelf area.

## Future Development Ideas
- [] Make it so that the shelves that are displayed show books immediately upon page load. Will require some code refactoring and more template literals.
- [] Add logic for if the user searches for a book they're already reading, there's a UI indication
- [] Should not be able to duplicate books on any list
- [] Send lists to friends
- [] Create way for user to login and store data on server
- [] User should be able to send list(s) to their friends.
- [] Count how many books are read over x time
- [] Add functionality to rate & store rating of book that's read
